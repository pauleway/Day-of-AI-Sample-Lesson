        Large language models are computer programs that can understand and generate human language. They are built
        using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>To understand how large language models work, it's important to know that they are trained on vast amounts of
        text data. The more data they are trained on, the better they can understand and generate language. </p>
      <p>
        The training process involves exposing the model to a huge corpus of text, like books, articles, and websites.
        The model then uses statistical patterns in the text to learn how words and phrases are related to each other,
        as well as how to predict the next word in a sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the model is trained, it can be used to generate human-like text. This is done by giving the model a
        prompt, like a sentence or a question, and letting it generate a response based on what it has learned during
        training.
      </p>
      <p>
        Large language models are used in a variety of applications, from language translation and chatbots to voice
        assistants and text completion tools. They are constantly improving as they are exposed to more data, and have
        the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate and interact with technology.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In a large language model, attention is a mechanism that helps the model focus on specific parts of the input
        text when predicting the next word in a sentence.</p>
      <p>When the model is given a sentence to predict the next word, it first encodes the sentence into a set of hidden
        representations, called the encoder. This encoder contains information about the sentence, such as the
        relationships between the words and the context of the sentence.</p>
      <p>Then, the attention mechanism is applied to the encoder. The attention mechanism computes a set of weights,
        indicating how important each hidden representation in the encoder is for predicting the next word. These
        weights are based on how well the hidden representations match the current state of the model and the context of
        the sentence.</p>
      <p>The attention mechanism then uses these weights to create a new, weighted sum of the hidden representations,
        called the context vector. The context vector captures the most relevant information in the encoder for
        predicting the next word.</p>
      <p>Finally, the context vector is passed through the decoder, which predicts the probability distribution over all
        possible words in the vocabulary. The decoder uses the context vector to generate the next word that is most
        likely to appear in the sentence.</p>
      <p>By using attention, the model can selectively focus on the parts of the input text that are most relevant for
        predicting the next word, rather than treating all parts of the input equally. This makes the model more
        accurate and efficient at predicting the next word in a sentence.</p>
